## 130 Vitality
---
#### 131 Resources
The overall state of a PC is manifested through three values:

- **==Health==** Points (*HP*) represent how many blows, grazes and near misses a PC can sustain before suffering serious injury or mortal wounds. Each time a PC would suffer damage, normally due to an attack, they lose HP (*based on the ferocity of the assault*). 

  > [!warning|noicon] If a PC reaches 0 HP and receives any further damage, they suffer exhaustion instead (*equal to the damage dealt*). All other effects are applied as normal.

- **==Stamina==** Points (*SP*) represent the energy of a PC, and the frequency with which they can exert themselves or attempt flourishes during their actions. A PC must spend SP (*based on the action taken*) to perform manoeuvres and utilise weapon masteries.
<br />
- **==Mana==** Points (*MP*) represent a PC's connection to the mystical, and their ability to draw from it to shape reality. Each time a PC would cast a spell, or activate another form of magical power, they must spend MP to do so (*based on the potency of the spell*).
##### Depleted Conditions
Whilst the value of a resource is equal to or below half of it's original (*maximum*) total, a special vitality condition is applied to the PC:
- Whilst ==Health== remains within this threshold, a PC is considered to be **Bloodied**.
- Whilst ==Stamina== remains within this threshold, a PC is considered to be **Fatigued**.
- Whilst ==Mana== remains within this threshold, a PC is considered to be **Drained**.

These conditions represent visible indicators that PCs can discern and react to. Certain powers, events or enemy behaviors can trigger when gaining (*or losing*) these conditions.

#### 133 Healing
Recovering vitality is mainly achieved via resting. However, many powers, spells and items also offer their own ways for a PC to regain ==health, stamina and mana==. 

In some situations, a PC may receive more healing than is required. A PC may not regain more resources than their maximum value, hence, any additional healing is lost.

Beyond the recovery of resources, there are other types of ailments that may affect a PC. These require attention as they manifest negative consequences until they are dealt with:

- Diseases reduce resilience, and a PC's abilities. They are fought over time, by the body's natural constitution, which in turn, can be helped by general medicines.
- Poisons affect the defences of a PC, making them more vulnerable. ==To remove poison, a PC needs a relevant antitoxin or a potion that targets poisons.==
- Curses can do a variety of things, often triggered by a particular action or event. To remove a curse, a PC must vanquish it's source, or locate a ==magical/religious== healer.
##### Temporary Vitality
Various medicinal and magical sources may provide ways for a PC to go beyond their maximum vitality thresholds, by providing temporary resources. A temporary resource (*i.e. temporary HP*) is an additional value alongside the core thresholds, ==and once depleted, it cannot be healed or refreshed.==

Generating new temporary resources immediately replaces any currently existing ones of the same type (regardless of whether they have been spent or not). 
All temporary resources are lost ==when commencing a rest==.
<br />
#### 132 Resting
A PC can naturally heal and recover lost vitality by resting in a safe, comfortable space.
The better the conditions, the faster their vigor will return.

To perform a rest check, the DM & PCs agree on the safety of their chosen resting spot.

|  Location  | Recovery TN |             Examples              |
| :--------: | :---------: | :-------------------------------: |
|    Safe    |      5      |  Own House, Faction Headquarters  |
|   Secure   |     10      |    ==Local Tavern, Queen's Keep==     |
| Vulnerable |     15      | ==Woodland Clearing, City Alleyway==  |
| Dangerous  |     20      |     ==Shelob's Lair, Jail Cell==      |
|  Hostile   |     25      | ==Goblin's Den, Necromancer's Tower== |
|   Deadly   |     30      |   ==Battlefield, Erupting Volcano==   |
<br />

==One of the PCs is nominated to make the check, and for each point above the TN rolled, the PCs gain Vitality Points. The PC may spend these points to restore Health (HP), Fatigue (FP) or Mana (MP) in any combination they desire (at a one-for-one exchange rate).==

==All unused recovery points are lost when the rest is concluded.==

==If they fail the check, they will suffer an interrupted rest. This can take many forms and vary in threat, from woodland creatures stealing food to full scale raiding parties on the hunt for blood. The DM will use the location and the duration of the PC's rest to determine what an encounter might be.==

==INDIIVUDALLY ROLL CON DICE?==

==In addition to basic relaxation, a PC may utilise certain comforts and luxuries to further improve their recovery:==
- ==Water - Fresh (clean) water== 
- ==Food - A good meal (rations is fine)==
- ==Warmth - A source of heat== 
- ==Dry -  Shelter from the elements==
- ==Bathing - Adequate wash and grooming faculties????????? entertainment?==

==For each of the comforts that apply to the PC's rest, they upgrade their proficiency die by one rank.==

> [!tip|noicon] roll once for whole party, separate rolls based on different prof dice is fine


==On Watch - PCs may volunteer to take watch in more volatile resting spots. They only regain half of the VP allotted to the party, but if an encounter does occur, anyone on watch gets to act first, before initiative begins.==

==Downtime action allocation?==
##### Resting Time
==When resting, if the PCs choose to spend a long (*or little*) time taking the rest, their ability to regain vitality points may differ. Spending a long time in an uncomfortable place may allow that little bit extra healing a PC needs.==

|    ==**Quick**==     |     ==**???**==     |     ==**???**==     |     ==**???**==     |     ==**???**==      |     ==**Long**==     |   ==**Extended**==    |
| :--------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: |
| .     +10      . | .     +5      . | .     +2      . | .      0      . | .      -2      . | .      -5      . | .      -10      . |
|      20mins      |     45mins      |     90mins      |      3hrs       |       6hrs       |      12hrs       |       24hrs       |


#### 134 Exhaustion
A PC may acquire exhaustion in many ways. Most notably whilst travelling, after performing arduous tasks, or when they are near death during combat.

For each rank of exhaustion they have, a PC reduces all of their d20 results by one before the result of a roll is determined (*critical boons and banes occur prior to this reduction*).

There is no limit to how much exhaustion a PC can receive, although once they surpass a high threshold (*i.e. -20*), a PC is virtually useless to their party, so effort should be made to keep this value to a minimum.

A PC cannot heal HP (*by any means*) whilst they have exhaustion. Instead, ranks of exhaustion are removed first, until there are none remaining, and then HP may be restored.
<br />
#### 135 Death
> [!danger|noicon] If a PC takes a critical hit whilst on 0 HP, they die.

If this happens, play is immediately halted, and the dying PC may perform one final action before they are removed from the game.

If they choose to do something requiring a check, they may add an additional d12 to that roll (*along with their regular proficiency die*) to symbolise their last gasp of heroic effort.

==NPCs die nromally==
##### Incapacitated
When an NPC reaches 0 HP, the PC that reduced them to that value may choose to incapacitate them (*instead of killing them*), ==If chosen to do so, the NPC gains a relevant condition (*usually unconscious*) until the current encounter is resolved.== 

==If an NPC recovers from the condition (*caused by incapacitation*), they will regain 1 HP.==

> [!warning|noicon] Based on an NPC's objectives, they may prefer to incapacitate a PC rather than kill them. The DM will make the PCs aware of this preference at the beginning of the encounter.
