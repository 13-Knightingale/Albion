COMMUNITIES IN HERE OR MOTIVATIONS??????

#### 141 Disposition
Every NPC has their own view on the actions the PCs take. Some may celebrate the slaying of monsters, others may value kindness and charity. Some will abide by anyone helping their village, whilst those who see through the lense of business care only about their coin.

To demonstrate this, each NPC has a disposition value, which represents their current mood towards the PCs. The higher the value, the more they appreciate and wish to help them.

> [!tip|noicon] Mechanically, disposition is used when a PC makes a request to an NPC. Narratively, they provide the DM with a guide on what the NPC may say, or how they may behave.

To begin with, an NPC will have a disposition of 0, unless the NPC is part of a faction which already has a noteworthy relationship with the PCs, or their reputation has proceeded them. In such cases, the DM may determine an alternative starting value.
<br />

|   **Nemesis**   |   **Hostile**   |  **Adversary**  |   **Neutral**   |  **Friendly**   |    **Loyal**    |   **Devout**    |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| .     -10     . | .     -5      . | .     -2      . | .      0      . | .     +2      . | .     +5      . | .     +10     . |
<br />

Whenever the PCs cause significant impact for an NPC, their disposition will change, positively or negatively, depending on the situation. Significant impacts include:
- Rescuing them from danger
- Giving (*or stealing*) an item of large value
- Protecting (*or hurting*) their loved ones or faction members
- Resolving difficult quests on their behalf

The DM will determine whether an NPC changes their disposition based on the PC's actions, and in which direction. An NPC's disposition value will only change by +/-1 per interaction, except in rare circumstances (*i.e. saving their life*), when the DM may change it by more.

> [!tip|noicon] When there are a lot of NPCs involved, the DM may elect for faction based disposition (*i.e. an entire village may share the same disposition towards the PCs*).

<br />

<br />

##### Personality
To further individualise prominent NPCs, they have a bespoke personality. This is a reflection of their most distinguished traits (*whether they be good or bad*). Personalities act as an indication of the NPC's greatest wants or needs, deepest fears or daily struggles.

A PC may discover an NPC's personality through interaction or intuition.

When the PCs significantly impact an NPC (*i.e. change their disposition*):
- If they do so in a manner that aligns with the personality of that NPC, their disposition is increased by an additional one (*i.e. solving a retired general's problem via military action*)
- If they do so in a way that conflicts or contradicts the NPC's personality, their disposition is further reduced by one (*i.e. accidently setting fire to a bookworm's library*)

> [!warning|noicon] In certain situations, the PCs may positively impact an NPC, but in a way that is adverse to their personality. This will cause the changes to cancel out, resulting in the NPC's overall disposition remaining the same (*i.e. rescuing a priest, by using occult magic*).

<br />

#### 142 Renown
Every PC has a level of prestige based on their previous actions, an aura of importance that may impress others. This is known as renown, and is initially based on a PC's background, although it can increase (*or decrease*) over time.

Whenever a PC succeeds at a check with a target number of 25 (*or higher*), they have performed a legendary act, thus, their renown is increased by one.

> [!danger|noicon] Whilst it is possible for a PC to suffer a reduction in renown, this is extremely rare, and solely at the DM's discretion (*i.e. the PC performs abysmally in a high profile event*).

When interacting with an NPC, a PC may spend an inspiration to permanently increase the disposition of that NPC equal to the value of their renown.

A PC may only do this once per NPC. 

> [!success|noicon] An NPC's disposition may be affected by the renown of multiple (*unique*) PCs.

#### 143 Requests
When a PC wishes an NPC to take an action (*or avoid taking one*), they make a request. 
A request is a social check used to determine whether an NPC grants a PC what they seek. This can be influenced by a number of factors, including the NPC's opinion of the PC.

> [!tip|noicon] The DM may forgoe this check, if they feel the NPC would strongly agree or disagree with the request regardless (*i.e. a king's guard will always protect the queen*).

To perform a request, the PC makes a standard check, but the TN is determined by how impactful their request would be on the NPC:
<br />

|                | **TN** |                                                  |
| :------------: | :----: | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Negligable** |   5    | *Minor inconvenience, low physical effort*       |
| **Reasonable** |   10   | *Interrupting current duties, notable duration*  |
| **Burdensome** |   15   | *Multiple requirements, significant duress*      |
|   **Risky**    |   20   | *Loss of social standing, investment of wealth*  |
|  **Radical**   |   25   | *Potential injury, major conflict of principles* |
|   **Insane**   |   30   | *Suicide mission, financial bankruptcy*          |
<br />

After the PC rolls their check, the DM adds the disposition of the NPC to the roll (*this can be kept secret if the DM wishes*) before being compared with the TN to determine success.

#### 144 Language
In order to communicate, those involved in the conversation must speak the same language. If a PC does not speak the same language as an NPC, they will not comprehend anything being discussed, although they may be able to interpret intent through other means.

> [!tip|noicon] Despite not knowing a language, it may be possible (*at the DM's discretion*), for a PC to pick up on some phrases that have become widely known (*i.e. thank you*). They may also detect pronouns embedded within the conversation (*i.e. the name of another NPC*).

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


$$
d20 + MAX[Proficiency|Language] => TN
$$

Every PC is able to speak Common. Beyond that, most have a native language dependent on their ancestry. A PC's designated native language never changes, regardless of how many new languages they may learn during their adventures.

> [!error|noicon] Common is never considered to be a native language, regardless of ancestry.

If a PC is able to communicate with an NPC in their native (*ancestral*) language, they gain advantage on any checks made during that interaction.

Being able to speak a language also conveys the ability to read and write in it.
<br />
#### 145 Knowledge
Throughout their lives, a PC absorbs a collection of facts, fiction, timelines and trivia. 
To represent this, each PC has a list of knowledge topics that they have a particular interest or understanding of. This list is made up of universal general knowledge, along with specific topics the PC may have been exposed to based on their ancestry, background, or class.

If a PC's knowledge relates to their adventure in some way, the DM will reveal more information, clues or context, depending on the situation. Topics don't have to be exact matches, in some cases, knowledge of a related topic may still offer a PC some insight.

> [!warning|noicon] There are no rolls for knowledge, either a PC is aware of a subject matter, or they are not.
##### General Knowledge
All PCs (*& NPCs*) have a shared set of knowledge, representing a collective awareness of:
- Basic History (*i.e. Global Events, Ancient Empires, Civilisation Milestones*)
- World Geography (*i.e. National Borders, Continental Climates, Natural Wonders*)
- Famous Figures (*i.e. Ruling Monarchs, Religious Leaders, Acclaimed Heroes*)

> [!tip|noicon] This list of general knowledge topics is not exclusive. Other topics may be added by the DM if they feel it is something most NPCs in their world would know.
