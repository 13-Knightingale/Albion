## 190 Spellcasting
---
#### 191 Casting A Spell
Each spell has a cost (MP) and whether it requires semantic or verbal spellcasting.
Semantic means use of hands or body language to cast a spell.
Verbal means words or vocal sounds to cast a spell.
Some spells are a mixture of both (usually powerful ones). If a PC is unable to perform this act (such as being restrained, so cannot perform semantic actions), they are unable to cast the spell, even if they have enough MP to do so.

##### Spellcasting Die
Each magical class has their own spellcasting die, this is what they roll as proficiency when making spellcasting checks. Various powers affect this die, so check before rolling!
##### Concentration
If a PC has cast a spell that requires concentration (usually those that persist/are ongoing), if they are hit with an attack or physical obstacle that requires them to move to avoid harm, along with comparing the attack value to their appropriate defence (i.e. Combat), also compare it against Fortitude. Regardless of whether the attack succeed, if it beats the WIL of the PC, their concentration is broken, and the spell is dissipated.
#### 192 Runes/Scrolls
Runes are ancient stones that have the capacity to hold latent magical energy. A PC in possession of a rune can choose to utilise it's power instead of their own. Expending a rune grants the user enough power to cast any spell, providing it matches the same type (fire, cold, psychic etc.), after which, they are empty and must be refueled by appropriate sources.

Scrolls are once step beyond runes, they are parchments of written word, that when spoken, cast a spell. The scroll is imbued with magical energy (much like a rune), thus, the person reading the spell need not the knowledge or the skill to cast any spells, but can use a scroll.

#### 193 Arcane Focus
Arcane Focuses are items that act sort of like weapons. They channel the PCs power through them when they cast spells. This has two benefits:
- They do not need semantic or verbal spellcasting (just wielding/gesturing with their focus)
- They unlock the ability to do stunts with their spells (varies based on focus type)

##### Attunement
In order to use an arcane focus, a PC must attune to it. This takes downtime. Once attuned, all works as normal, but if they lose or cannot wield their focus, they cannot cast spells. A PC may only be attuned to one focus at a time.
#### 194 Spell Components
Spell components are consumable ingredients that can cause wild effects on a PC's spells. Some cause the damage type to change, others to have a wider berth. A PC can choose to use a component alongside a spell providing they have a minor action to do so.
