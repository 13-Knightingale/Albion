## Downtime Activities
Whenever the PCs have no direct goals to strive for, or the plot requires a period of waiting, the DM may call for downtime.

Downtime is a collection of small or simple encounters, rarely requiring more than a single check to accomplish. Each PC can take part in different types of downtime activities, creating a montage of events that represent the casual passing of time.

When a DM determines downtime is appropriate, they will award each PC with a number of downtime actions (DA), based on how much time the downtime is meant to represent.

> [!tip|noicon] Downtime actions are deliberately abstract, and can be scaled by the DM as desired. However, as a suggested baseline, a PC may spend up to four downtime actions per day.

The PCs will then decide what to spend their downtime actions on. They discuss their wishes with the DM, who decides whether a check is required, what the DEGRESS OF SUCCESS!!! TN for the check will be, what the outcome of a successful check will be, and most importantly, how many downtime actions it would cost to attempt it.

> [!warning|noicon] Not every activity will be available each time the PCs are granted downtime (*i.e. some may be location dependent or based on the time of day*). The DM will determine which actions are available in any given downtime.
