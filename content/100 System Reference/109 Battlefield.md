## Zones LANDMARKS
The battlefield is a collection of abstract areas, known as zones.

> [!tip|noicon] There is no set size for combat zones. The DM should try and ensure all zones in a combat, and the relative distances between them, are roughly equal. A large area may be made up of several contiguous zones to account for this. 

Each zone may contain multiple PCs (*& NPCs*), and may have interactable objects that the DM may describe as the battle progresses.

Certain zones are adjacent to one another, allowing PCs to move between them with their move action. The DM will make clear if there are any obstructions/walls etc. to block this movement. Certain zones may only be accessible by moving through other zones.

Each zone will also dictate whether there is any cover available (partial/full), any terrain conditions, elevation, etc.
#### Range Bands
There are three 'ranges' for weapons, spells, abilities, etc.:
- Melee: Current zone. Swords.
- Short: One adjacent zone. Throwing.
- Long: Any zone within line of sight. Bows.

## Terrain
Not all zones are easy to traverse, stand or balance upon. Different terrain types affect the ability to move through them.

- **Difficult Terrain**: This is anything that would make moving more time consuming, like loose shale, deep mud, or an area of extra high gravity. These are best represented by smooshing several Zones into the same physical space a single normal Zone would usually take up. This results in players having to take multiple Moves to move across a shorter physical distance. If you need to count distance for something other than movement (like weapon range), treat this area as one Zone as normal.

- **Hazardous Terrain**: Anything that might hurt you by being in it, such as lava, poison gas, or radiation. These work equally well as borders between zones or as zones themselves, as appropriate. They are best represented as NPCs that will make a Reaction when a character moves on or through them. The nature of the Reaction is based on the Element in question.

- **Blocking Terrain**: These are Elements that will prevent movement on or through them. Examples include deep chasms, tall walls, or forcefields. They usually work well as borders or Zones, very rarely as an object in a Zone. Characters cannot move through them unless they have some kind of unusual ability, such as flight.

## Elevation
Battlefields aren't perfectly flat. Whenever a zone is higher than adjacent zones, it is elevated. Being elevated provides advantage to all attacks, and detection checks on lower levels. The DM may also deem melee (or short range) attacks impossible, if the elevation is great enough.

Makes throwing farther?
#### Falling
If a PC moves off an elevated zone, they fall to the level on an adjacent zone. A PC suffers one wound/damage, if they fall more than twice their height (and another wound for each 2xheight after that).

> [!tip|noicon] Falling is essentially enforced movement, resulting in a collision with the ground.

## Cover
 Rarely will a battlefield be empty. There are many things (*i.e. furniture, shrubbery, walls*) that can make it difficult for attacks to hit their target.
 
 A PC may use their movement action to take cover. This represents the PC shifting their position, to utilise the cover available **within their current zone** (*if any*). The benefits a PC receives depend on the size and quality of cover used:

- **Partial Cover** (*also known as Soft Cover*) provides the PC with protection against ranged attacks. Any attacks made from outside of the PC's zone are made with disadvantage.

- **Full Cover** (*also known as Hard Cover*) provides the PC with protection against all incoming attacks. Any attack made against the PC is done so with disadvantage.

> [!warning|noicon] The PC taking cover is also subject to these restrictions (*i.e. if they take partial cover their ranged attacks are also made with disadvantage*).

A PC can choose to target the source of cover with their attack, possibly destroying it.

## Concealment
Sometimes a PC may create an area of dust, smoke or magic that blocks vision.
Examples include a dense forest, a wall of steam, or a shifting crowd.
The benefits a PC receives depend on the type of concealment:

- **Partially Concealed** (*also known as Obscured) blocks line of sight to all zones behind it.

- **Fully Concealed** (*also known as Hidden) completely hides the PC from any detection or attack. It blocks line of sight to all zones behind it.

> [!tip|noicon] If a PC chooses to attack into an area they cannot see/sense, the DM may treat it as a missed ranged attack, and randomise the target. This roll is made with disadvantage.

Certain PCs have senses that can ignore vision limitations.
