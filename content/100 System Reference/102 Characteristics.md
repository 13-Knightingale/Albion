## Abilities
There are six characteristics that represent the physical and mental aptitude of a PC.
These abilities indicate the skill and training a PC may call upon throughout their adventures.

Abilities are represented as proficiency dice ranks. When a check calls for an ability die as the proficiency dice. By far, the most common proficiency die used when making a check will be the ability die.

Abilities form the baseline for almost every action taken during gameplay. Even when not directly used (*i.e. whilst in combat*), their influence persists (*i.e. what weapons can wielded, how impactful a spell may be, which enemies are likely to retreat*).

- **Strength** represents the sheer might of a PC. How much force they can apply to a weapon swing, door kick, rope pull or similar powerful movement. It also determines how much they can lift and how far they can throw.
- **Dexterity** represents the agility, mobility and flexibility of a PC. It affects their prowess at evasion along with their sense of balance, fine motor control and how accurately they can follow a complex choreography.
- **Constitution** represents the PC's body, and how much strain it can endure before failing. It is usually called upon for tasks of excessive duration, to allay the effects of tiredness or when suppressing internal ailments (*i.e. disease, alcohol, hunger*).
- **Intelligence** represents a PC's raw brain power. How much detail they can comprehend and how much of it they might retain. In addition, it demonstrates mental capacity for problem solving, logical reasoning and quick thinking.
- **Wisdom** represents the emotional maturity and intuition of a PC. Their ability to judge the temperament of crowds or creatures, to adapt in unexpected situations, and to utilise their past experiences to form unique or novel suggestions.
- **Charisma** represents a PC's suaveness and tact. How freely they find conversations, and how comfortable others find their company. It can indicate their talent at mediation or manipulation, and is often helped by having an attractive complexion.

## Defences
There are six characteristics that demonstrate how a PC protects themselves from threats.
These defences determine how much a PC can naturally avoid, withstand or detect.

Each defence value is derived from the PC's abilities, and may be temporarily improved through the usage of equipment (*i.e. carrying a shield*) or certain powers (*i.e. slowing time*).

In almost all cases, every action made by a PC against an NPC will utilise one of their defences as the target number for that check. Likewise, the PC's defences will be used when NPCs take actions against them.

- **Combat** allows a PC to survive in battle against dangerous foes. Their skill to nullify incoming assaults, utilise their armour to full effect and maintain the right stance for maximum protection against counter blows or lethal swings. 
- **Reflex** allows a PC to evade harm by moving quickly. Their speed of thought, and of body, to dodge incoming projectiles, to grab a ledge when falling, or to stay on their feet when the ground beneath them becomes unsteady.
- **Fortitude** allows a PC to resist physical impacts or forced movement. Often used when a collision is unavoidable, or weapons would offer no benefit. It also allows a PC to fend off more encompassing forms of bodily assault, like noxious gases or crushing grips.
- **Awareness** allows a PC to avoid surprises. Whether they be physically hidden, requiring keen senses to detect, or emotionally driven, calling upon alertness and experience to hear unspoken words or feel changes in surrounding atmospheres.
- **Willpower** allows a PC to remain focused and dedicated despite duress. Their discipline and mental stoicism to block unwelcome intrusions or distractions, whilst their inner drive keeps them committed to pushing on with the task at hand.
- **Presence** allows a PC to stand tall, figuratively and literally, in social situations. It grants them an aura of authority, reassuring allies whilst unnerving opponents, and a conviction of personality, making any attempt to sway their ideals a daunting challenge.
