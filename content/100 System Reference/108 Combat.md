### Reactions
Several powers are reactions, you can spend the cost (EP/MP) to interrupt an enemy turn when a given condition is met. Your power executes, then go back to enemy turn.

### Actions
1 Main + (Unlimited) Minor actions, or replace with movement.
Main + Minor/Main + Move/Move + Minor/Move + Move
Main/Major - Attack, Spell, Power (anything that requires a roll, usually)
Minor - unlimited minor actions (DM discretion), will be designated as minor
Move - anywhere within zone, move into adjacent zone (but not take cover), so two moves gets you to adjacent zone then take cover

#### 173 Making An Attack
An attack roll is a normal check, using the weapon die as proficiency. The target of the attack uses the defence noted by the weapon, and the PC may add their attribute score (i.e. STR) to the check to determine if they hit.

If they hit, they do one damage.

They may trigger a stunt

 - An ally is killed
 - a PC triggers a special power
