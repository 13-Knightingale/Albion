***Well, that escalated quickly...***

When I originally set out on this project, I had intended to publish a handful of D&D homebrew suggestions, modular in fashion, that reintroduced some of my favorite elements from fourth edition, whilst simultaneously addressing what I perceived to be the most significant drawbacks of fifth edition (*i.e. the vast inequality between ability scores, lack of tangible social mechanics and the infamously laborious initiative tracking*).

These modules were to be "*backwards convertible*", meaning that a DM, after performing an initial calculation step, could integrate them into their ongoing games without needing to adapt other parts of their system, or retcon previous tabletop rulings. It would even be possible to revert these changes without destablising a campaign.

But alas, when drafting my house rules, the synergies I found proved too interesting and too intuitive to ignore, and once modules began building on similar mechanics, dependencies emerged. It became almost necessary to use multiple modules at once in order to maximise their effect, and thus, after several bouts of denial, I pivoted the project into producing a comprehensive homebrew framework, under the banner of a "*reimagined, streamlined 5e*".

This new viewpoint still embodied the spirit of the original plan, but also encouraged me to review sections of the rulebooks that I was otherwise fairly happy with, in order to find mechanical efficiencies and alignment opportunities with the aforementioned modules. 

This also led to the emergence of a behavior I refer to as "*deliberate omission*".

Everybody runs their game differently. Most have their own house rules, and many of them generalise or amalgamate details in order to make their lives easier. By purposefully not offering my own homebrew option for a given element, I am acknowledging that it would most likely be ignored or redacted by the reader anyway... *so why bother writing it?*

Unsurprisingly therefore, I decided against providing complex subsystems that support scenarios most players never experience (*looking at you, mounted combat*). Instead, I would focus on core features, simplifying and unifying their mechanics as much as possible. 

Finally, I enhanced any areas I still found lacking with my own unique rules and repurposed ideas, taking inspiration from numerous sources (*i.e. previous editions of D&D, homebrew communities, alternative TTRPGs, and the occasional video game*).

**The result of all that hard work is this custom ruleset which, I hope, still captures the essence of D&D, but manifests much swifter and satisfying gameplay for everyone at the table. It is not verbose, nor is it exhaustive, and that is by design. These pages provide a strong and flexible foundation, the rest is up to you.**
