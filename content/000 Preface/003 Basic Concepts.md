> [!summary|noicon] In order to maintain consistency throughout this document, the term 'Dungeon Master' will be abbreviated to *DM*, players and their characters will be jointly referenced as *PC*s, and any other role, monster or independent agent will be referred to as an *NPC*.
##### Specific Over Generic
In all cases, if an individual power, item, spell or similar trigger describes an effect that contradicts the core rules of this system, that exception always takes precedence.
##### Always Round Down
If any calculation produces a fractional value, that result should be rounded down to the nearest whole number, or if necessary, to the nearest usable number beyond that.
##### Referee Before Rules
Conversation and discussion are actively encouraged, however, for adjudication of gameplay, including the addition, alteration or removal of rules, the DM is the final authority.

## Dice Ranks

This system treats the various sizes of dice (*d4, d6, d8, etc.*) as stages of a singular 'chain'. 
Each stage of this chain is referred to as a rank.

| **Rank** |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  | **5** |
| :------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: |
|   Dice   |  -  | d4  | d6  | d8  | d10 |  d12  |

Whenever a rule refers to a dice in the form of a rank, this may be translated into the appropriate size by finding the stage in the chain that is equal to that rank's value. 

Certain effects can temporarily increase or decrease a dice rank, which requires moving one stage higher or lower on the chain, before converting it back into the given size.
