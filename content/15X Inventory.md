## 150 Inventory
---
#### 151 Size
PCs (*& NPCs*) are classified into one of several size bands. These sizes affect how much a PC can carry in their inventory, and how much they benefit from taking cover.

**TINY** *0.5-1.0m (2ft), 10-15kg*
Carry Capacity: 2
Partial Cover provides the benefit of Full Cover.
No Cover provides the benefit of Partial Cover.

**SMALL** *1.0-1.5m (4ft), 30-40kg*
Carry Capacity: 4
Partial Cover provides the benefits of Full Cover.

**MEDIUM** *1.5-2.0m (6ft), 60-75kg*
Carry Capacity: 6

**LARGE** *2.0-2.5m (8ft), 100-120kg*
Carry Capacity: 8
Partial Cover provides no benefit.

**HUGE** *2.5-3.0m (10ft), 150-175kg*
Carry Capacity: 10
Partial Cover provides no benefit.
Full Cover only provides the benefit of Partial Cover.

For NPCs that fall outside the bands above, they are grouped as follows: 

- **MINIATURE** (*< Tiny*) creatures always gain the benefits of Full Cover, regardless of their location. However, they have zero carrying capacity.
- **MASSIVE** (*> Huge*) creatures gain no benefits from any kind of cover. Carrying capacity may vary, but is often calculated as one inventory slot per foot of height.

> [!tip|noicon] The heights and weights provided are rough guidelines. An NPC may be designated a size band based on either (*or neither*) of those characteristics (*i.e. a horse that is 5ft tall, but weighs 420kg, may be classified as Large*)

#### ==152 Inventory Slots==
The weight, size, encumbrance, and storage of items is represented by inventory slots. Every PC has a backpack, and they can carry a certain amount of slots (*based on their size*). Unless otherwise stated, all gear and armour require one inventory slot to carry.

CUSTOMISATION

It is possible a PC to purchase (*or craft*) customisations for their backpack. This will allow them to carry a handful related items in a single inventory slot, rather than carrying them separately (*i.e. a potion belt takes up one inventory slot, but holds up to three potions). 

>[!warning|noicon] In some encounters, NPCs may sunder (destroy) items. This is done at random, but items sharing the same slot will all be destroyed if the slot is chosen.

#### 153 Equipping Items
A PC my also equip gear (carry it on their person, not in their backpack), up to a certain limit. A PC may carry two one handed weapons (or single double handed weapon), one headpiece, one pair of boots, one pair of gloves/gauntlets, a set of clothes, one robe, etc. DM descretion.
There are also miscalleanous items, usually jewlery that have no limit (rings, necklaces, bracelets).
